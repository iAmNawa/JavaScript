#Data Types
There are 7 data types in JavaScript.
 string
 number
 object
 boolean
 null
 undefined
 symbol

#string
Strings are simply a group of characters surrounded by single or double quotes.
'hello'
"hello"
#number
A number is a numerical value.
#object
An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.
#boolean
Either true or false
#null
The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value.
#undefined
undefined is a property of the global object, i.e. it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.
#symbol
*New in ES6*
A symbol is a unique and immutable data type. It may be used as an identifier for object properties. The Symbol object is an implicit object wrapper for the symbol primitive data type.
